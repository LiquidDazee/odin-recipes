    <h3>What Makes This Cookie Dough Edible?</h3>
    <p>Traditional cookie dough is unsafe to consume before it’s baked because of the presence of eggs and raw flour. This recipe doesn’t contain eggs at all, but it does contain all-purpose flour — that’s why it’s important to heat-treat the flour (cook it at a high temperature to kill the dangerous bacteria) before you incorporate it into the dough. </p>

            <li>Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until creamy. Beat in vanilla extract and salt. Add heat-treated flour; mix until a crumbly dough forms. Stir in milk until dough is just combined; fold in milk chocolate chips and mini chocolate chips.</li>
